# -WIP-Implementation-of-Repository-Pattern

While practicing repository pattern with WebAPI, I've encountered a new problem: I need a simple, yet easy nuget package to use Console Interface, which can show/fill C# object. Added to my ToDo list and moving on.

Expect to use repository pattern while creating this package as well as making it open source and avaliable online in order to use if anyone might need one.

I expect next funtions:
- Display Object
- Display AND fill Object
- Draw simple grid with customizable formatting
- Return Dictionary<Key, Value> from Object
- Use repository patter for separation of concerns
- Enjoy developing :)
